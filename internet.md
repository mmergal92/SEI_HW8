## Answers to Homework 8 questions
#### What is the difference between a client and a server?
- Client computers are not directly connected to the internet. They connect to an ISP (Internet service provider) that then connects to the internet. A server connects directly to the internet.

#### What is the request-response cycle?
- You make a request (most commonly either a GET request to find a webpage or a POST request to login in to a site) and that request gets sent to the router, then to the modem, then to the ISP which connects to the internet and then to the server you are trying to access. When it responds, it goes through that whole process in the opposite direction to reach your client computer. The response consists of a header (that has metadata and shows whether the request could be completed or not) and the body (which includes the html and the website that you can see). 

#### Define html
- HTML stands for hyper text markup language. 
- It is a language that tells the browser how to make the page look.
- Text is included directly in there but you can also link images from other sites directly into it, as well.

#### Define http
- HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, which is the language that one computer uses to ask another computer for something. 
- All http requests go to port 80. All https requests go to port 443.

#### Define Front End
- Frontend is the part of the web that you can see and consists of both web design and front end web development. Web designers that work in front end design use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and/or jQuery. Everything from fonts to buttons to contact forms are part of front end, but you need backend to make it a complete site that can store information and so that the website is usable.

#### According to the article, what are the three parts of the backend?
- The 3 parts include a server, an application, and a database. It is able to store information so that when you log back into a site or application all your information is there in your account.
